        Well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST
        API is accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to
        retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
        way.

        This complete server-side can be used for building web application. It includes the server, business logic, and
        business layers of the application. Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the
        server-side of the application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
        data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like to read
        information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their list of “Favorite
        Movies.”
